# Pharmaceutical Demand Forecasting

A machine learning project to forecast pharmaceutical demand using the Prophet library, with a pipeline simulating data extraction, cleaning, modeling, and visualization. The project demonstrates skills in time series forecasting, data preprocessing, and cloud integration.

## Project Description
This project builds a time series forecasting model to predict pharmaceutical demand, replicating a professional workflow:
- **Data Source**: Synthetic dataset mimicking SAP S/4HANA sales data.
- **Preprocessing**: Data cleaning using Pandas (simulating AWS Glue).
- **Modeling**: Time series forecasting with Prophet.
- **Deployment**: Simulated AWS SageMaker deployment.
- **Visualization**: Placeholder for Tableau dashboard integration.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Pharma-Demand-Forecasting.git
